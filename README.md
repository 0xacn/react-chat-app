To get the API/Socket.io server up

First off, Create an account for mongodb.com as you need your own cluster/database to run this application. There are clusters that cost exactly 0$ So you dont have to worry about any fees. 

> Note: If you already have an account or just created one, Follow this tutorial on how to setup a cluster with security/credentials.

Before running make sure in /server/configs you replace your mongo credentials with your own.



```
cd server
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
